Rahvakogu is a platform to allow citizens to have a voice in democracy. At least, we're trying. And only in Estonia.

This project is a branch of <a href="https://github.com/hinrik/social_innovation">Social Innovation</a>, itself a merge between NationBuilder by <a href="http://www.jimgilliam.com/">Jim Gilliam</a>  and <a href="http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy">Open Direct Democracy</a> by Róbert Viðar Bjarnason and Gunnar Grimsson.

We have simplified and modified some aspects of Social Innovation for the Estonian environment. Login requires the Eesti ID card or MobileID; if you aren't using this in Estonia, it may not be particularly useful for you.

<a href="http://www.rahvakogu.ee/">Rahvakogu</a> launched to the public in January 2013; proposals were collected for one month, and currently they are being reviewed, with parliament set to have a look in April.
