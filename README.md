Rahvakogu is a platform to allow citizens to have a voice in democracy. At least, we're trying. And only in Estonia.

This project is a branch of 
Social Innovation

itself a merge between:

NationBuilder by Jim Gilliam
"http://www.jimgilliam.com/":http://www.jimgilliam.com/

* Jim's Nationbuilder has itself evolved into an excellent political campaign website
"http://www.nationbuilder.com/":http://www.nationbuilder.com/

and

Open Direct Democracy by Róbert Viðar Bjarnason and Gunnar Grimsson
"http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy":http://github.com/rbjarnason/open-direct-democracy

We have simplified and modified some aspects of Social Innovation for the Estonian environment. Login requires the Eesti ID card or MobileID; if you aren't using this in Estonia, it may not be particularly useful for you.
